Most of my work is open source, and I have contributed to various projects, libraries, and services. Below is a selection of my contributions, including libraries I have developed, services I maintain, and project collaborations.

### Libraries

- [MQTTClient](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/paclema/MQTTClient) – A C++ MQTT client library for ESP32 and ESP8266 that transparently wraps ESP-IDF mqtt client component on ESP32 and PubSubClient on ESP8266. Easy to configure with secure connections and WebConfigServer integration.
- [WebConfigServer](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/paclema/WebConfigServer) – Arduino-ESP C++ library for ESP8266 and ESP32 that creates a web-based configuration server to manage device settings stored in a config.json file on SPIFFS and display real-time data on a dashboard.
- [PowerManagement](https://github.com/paclema/PowerManagement) – Arduino-ESP32 C++ library to handle power status based on MCP73831/2, TP4054 and TP4065 battery charger ICs

### Services
- [tuya_powermonitor](https://github.com/paclema/tuya_powermonitor) – Service that reads tuya devices status and save it into an influxdb database.

### Collaborations
- [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin ) – A popular open-source firmware for 3D printers.
- [Miniblip](https://hack-miniblip.github.io/) – A board to create wearable devices and fast prototyping.
