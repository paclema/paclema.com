Born and raised in Madrid, Pablo studied Industrial Electronics Engineering at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). Throughout his career, he has traveled extensively across Spain for work, talks, and workshops in various cities, eventually making Leipzig, Germany his current home since 2017. As an electronics engineer, he channels his passion for open source, hardware, and creative projects into innovative solutions that bridge the digital and physical worlds.

When he's not deep in code or tinkering with circuits, you'll likely find him pushing pedals on his bike, lacing up running shoes, or probably praying not to fall at the climbing hall. He's also constantly exploring new ways to make music and experimenting with his sourdough starter – because apparently, engineering principles apply to bread fermentation too.

Pablo believes in learning, sharing knowledge, and collaborating with communities worldwide, always with a curious mind and a readiness to tackle the next interesting challenge.
