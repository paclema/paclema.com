At IOTIQ GmbH I worked as an Embedded & IoT Systems Engineer involved in the design and development of hardware, firmware, and integration of smart embedded systems. My work covered both B2B projects for clients (such as DEMAG or Deskcenter) and R&D-driven initiatives under European frameworks (ITEA, Horizon Europe), and also internal product development such as AccessCtrl.

I participated end-to-end in the architecture, development, prototyping, testing, and deployment of embedded solutions, often combining hardware design (PCB), firmware (C/C++, FreeRTOS), and communication stacks (MQTT, Bluetooth, NFC, LoRaWAN). In addition, I was also responsible for DevOps processes (CI/CD, containerization, infrastructure automation) as well as full-stack development where needed, including backend services and Angular-based frontends.

My role evolved to include project leadership and mentoring, especially in later stages of internal product development for multiple projects such as AccessCtrl and InnoSale.

#### Main Responsibilities

- Hardware design (PCB, ESP32/ESP8266, sensors)
- Firmware development (C/C++, FreeRTOS, MQTT, NFC, BLE)
- DevOps (CI/CD, Docker, Azure Pipelines)
- Full-stack development (Angular, FastAPI, Keycloak)
- Project leadership and mentoring
- Collaboration in multinational R&D consortia and European-funded innovation projects (ITEA, Horizon Europe)


#### Notable Projects

</div>

During my period at Sensape, I mainly analyzed and streamlined the development pipeline from business ideas to the customer experience, focusing on redefining the current architecture to customize applications and services easily for different customers, reducing repetitive work, simplifying triage work needed to fix issues, and improving the time of development, support, and production deployment of new features.

To reach those goals, I developed:

- Configuration-handler: Merged several configs (following Linux priority standard style) and restarted the apps and services involved, applying those configurations. Also exported configuration for third-party software components handling several formats, such as JSON5, JSON, or YAML.
- Reduced existing strong coupling and increased cohesion among different services and applications by developing unit services to manage Front-end, hardware modules, and Back-end services.
- Application-handler: Redistributed specific configurations among the system, removing redundancy, duplicated code, and the same functionality between different applications. Redesigned the whole Back-end architecture to fit the new configuration paradigm, adding a legacy layer for old systems.
- Created a Python library to work in sync with the Configuration-handler ecosystem and easily configure classes or libraries imported on Python services.
- Developed a service to reshape and convert production devices to development mode, managing Linux user configurations, deb package components and versions installed, networking interfaces, and cloning and installing repositories for debugging and developing. Also added the fallback to production operations, keeping new desired staged configurations.
- Reduced several common issues by adding automated scripts to fix systemd services, such as the local MongoDB, display and touch screen, or hard disk failures.
- Documented new infrastructure and supported migration of services for the China region.
