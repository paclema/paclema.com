**Never miss a delivery again.** Transform your ordinary mailbox into a smart notification system that instantly alerts you when mail arrives or is collected. This battery-powered IoT sensor runs for months on a single charge and seamlessly integrates with your home automation setup.

## How it Works

**Installation:** The device is installed inside the mailbox with switches positioned to detect when the mail slot or door is opened.

**Operation Flow:**
1. **Detection**: Switch sensors detect when the mail slot opens (delivery) or mailbox door opens (collection)
2. **Processing**: Device wakes from low-power sleep, identifies the trigger source, and processes the event
3. **Notification**: Sends wireless notification via WiFi/MQTT or LoRaWAN to your home system
4. **Sleep**: Returns to ultra-low power mode to preserve battery life

**Benefits:**
- Real-time delivery and collection notifications
- Know when mail has been collected  
- Monitor mailbox activity remotely
- Integrate mailbox status into home automation systems
